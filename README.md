[Weekend schedule](./schedule.html)

## tl;dr
what is a wedding but an excuse to hang out? we are celebrating our mawwiage by forcing(?) our friends & family upstate for a weekend of hanging out, food, and festivities. 

* **when**: may 2026
* **where**: [Inn at Taughannock falls](https://www.inntfalls.com/)
* **accomodation**: we would love for folks to stay on the property with us for the weekend! to that end, if you choose to stay on premise with us, we will subsidizie the cost of the 2-night stay (aka, you'll only need to pay for 1 night). there are 3 dog friendly rooms! rooms are first come, first served. you're welcome to stay elsewhere at your own cost.
* **getting there**: your options are (1) fly into the Ithaca Tompkins International Airpot (~25 min from the inn) or (2) take a [bus, e.g. from nyc](https://www.wanderu.com/en-us/bus/us-ny/ithaca/us-ny/new-york/). availability of ubers should be pretty decent.
* **& eating there**: you know I (KZ) care about food the most. we will host a 'rehearsal dinner' in the inn restaurant (see their [latest tasting menu](https://www.inntfalls.com/drink-dine/the-inn-restaurant#cms-menu)) Fri night, a lot of food Saturday, and then a goodbye brunch on Sunday. what can I say. I live to eat.
